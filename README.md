# Simple multithreaded HTTP GET Server

Simple multithreaded HTTP GET server written entirely in C.  
This is a simple HTTP web/file server that hosts a simplified version of the HTTP GET and HEAD methods.

This project is expanded from Gatech's GIOS GETFILE server project.  
The design is roughly based off of Python's [http.server](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html) module.
